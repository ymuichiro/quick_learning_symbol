# Introduction

## This document aims to

This manual is designed to help you quickly learn the skills required for utilisation of the Symbol blockchain. Unlike general official documents that deal with the technology comprehensively, this document is structured in a way that if you read it from the beginning, you can learn the whole picture of utilisation of the Symbol blockchain for developing applications in a systematic way without difficulty.  
Incidentally, this document does not refer to the following matters, the node hosting method, consensus algorithm and incentive rewards.

## People subject to this document

- Those who would like to give blockchain a try, but don't know where to start learning.
- Those who learn about blockchain but still do not come to mind what it can be used for.
- Those who are trying to create educational material on Symbol blockchain but are wondering what steps to take to educate it.
- Those who want to know the point how it easy about the Symbol briefly, although the Symbol is often described as an easy to use blockchain.

## What does "practically" mean?

The minimum unit of data that configures a blockchain is not a currency, but a proof of existence with a time stamp. With the focus here, blockchain can further expand its uses, such as authentication, traceability and much more. If you look around in the society, you can see that everything is **built on a connection based on trust**. Because of the difficulty in formalising that trust, a lot of things have been converted to currencies.

Today, blockchain technology makes it possible to record that trust in unfalsifiable forms without converting it into currencies. This document has been written to give people working **"practically "** on business and culture, not only in finance but also in many more fields, and tips on how to leverage the power of blockchain.

## Meaning 'from today', not 'from tomorrow'

Recently, in the field of IoT and other developments, it is sometimes expressed that "No longer even a need for PoC". The IT components are becoming modulars. Modulations are bringing us the fact that even a trial device can be put into operation without any modification.
The Symbol blockchain is also a platform which allows the configured accounts and tokens to be used as a highly secure intelligence infrastructure as it is, with an available suite of tools provided by the community, without the need to build own applications nor nodes .

I hope that this document will show you these possibilities. Please note that the 'Tips for use in the field' at the end of each chapter requires a cross-disciplinary knowledge of each function, so you can skip them at first.

## What the Symbol blockchain doesn't have.

For those who have developed in other chains, I leave a little explanation of it.

The Symbol blockchain doesn't have any contract accounts. Therefore, there is no idea of deploying smart contracts, and all smart contracts functioning in Symbol are executed only once and lose their effect, hence sometimes described as a deployless one-time smart contract.

Since, as a deployless chain, the smart contracts can be written in any familiar language without the need to use a dedicated language for that, and as they are executed only once, it doesn't consume large amounts of network resources due to improper loop control, and also free from vulnerabilities by marcious abusing reuse of logic in the contract.
